 * Specific exception indicating that the library detected an attempt to insert two alert messages

 * 
 * Methods in the PushNotification class which cause an alert entry to be added to the payload
 * (addAlert, addCustomAlert__, etc.) will throw this exception (upcasted as a JSONException) if
 * the library detects that your action will cause two alert keys to be added to the payload.
 * 
 * You do not need to catch this exception specifically, as catching its parent JSONException will
 * catch a variety of payload construction-related exeptions including this one.
