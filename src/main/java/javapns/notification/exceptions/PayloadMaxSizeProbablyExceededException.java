 * Specific exception indicating that a payload would probably exceed the maximum size allowed
 * if the current property addition were to complete, but thrown only if you explicitely invoked
 * payload.setPayloadSizeEstimatedWhenAdding(true) before calling that add___ method.
 * 
 * Since this feature is not enabled by default, you do not need to worry about this 
 * exception unless you decide to enable it manually.
 * 
 * Further more, you do not need to catch this exception specifically, as catching its parent 
 * JSONException will catch a variety of payload construction-related exeptions including this one.
